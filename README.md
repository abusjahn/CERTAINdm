# CERTAIN data management

CERTAIN is a state-of-the-art European registry and academic research network for paediatric renal transplantation

Data are exported into excel sheets with various formats. This makes data management somewhat complicated. Pivoting tables from long to wide, joining data by patient and visit, re-exporting clean data for R or SPSS require substantial effort.

CERTAINdm is providing functions to ease the process by providing concise summaries of variables in the various sheets, transforming data ino dates or numbers were appropriate, and more.

The ultimate goal is a shiny app making the process of data preprocessing interactive and easy for researchers.

This is work in progress, beware!
